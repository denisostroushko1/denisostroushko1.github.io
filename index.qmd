# About me

Hello there! I'm a data scientist and statistician by day, and a devoted soccer enthusiast in my free time.

I am finishing my MS in Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health in May 2024, delving into the fascinating realm of early identification and progression times to Alzheimer's Disease. My research involved leveraging Electronic Health Records and data from the ADNI Cohort Study.

Beyond crunching numbers, you'll find me on the soccer field, playing in various leagues across Minneapolis and helping steer the ship at Royal FC. I'm not just about goals on the pitch â€“ I love diving into the data to analyze the science behind our scoring strategies.

Outside the world of statistics and sports, my heart belongs to fitness, biking adventures, nurturing plants, and indulging in a good round of board and card games!
